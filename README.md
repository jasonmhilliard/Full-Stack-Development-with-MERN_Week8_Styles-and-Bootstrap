# Styles-and-Bootstrap
Week8: Styles and Bootstrap

I. File list
------------
CSS Styling and Bootstrap - Microsoft Word Document

indexHTMLStyleExercise - HTML file

cssStyleExercise - CSS file


II. Concept
----------
The word document discusses how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.  It also talks about CSS styles, the grid layout in the DOM and the use of BOOTSTRAP.

The indexHTMLStyleExercise HTML file provides a very basic HTML page layout. When you link the cssStyleExercise CSS file to the HTML document it applies the CSS stylesheet to the HTML page completely changing the layout.  You will need to download both files into the same folder and then drag and drop the HTML file into an empty browser tab. Lastly, you will need to reference the CSS filename by changing the code in your HTML document here: <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">


III. Future Improvements
----------
Provide additional plain HTML pages and spicing them up with fancy CSS stylesheets.
